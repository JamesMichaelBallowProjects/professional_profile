                    I'm a solutions architect that is extremely passionate about creating, and developing
                        things that are extraordinary. I'm
                        a real go-getter and I am not shy to take on challenges. I like to try new
                        things, learn new technologies, and I push extremely hard to accomplish the things that
                        are challenging. I never quit, I never back down, and I never put aside a challenge. My
                        deal is this: 'You give me the time and the resources, and I will provide you a solution.'

                            During my Master's Program, I worked tirelessly on hand gesture detection to find methods
                            that would
                            assist in detecting hands in monochromatic thermal images (very few features). Detecting
                            hands is
                            actually a pretty tricky problem. It can be a computationally expensive task unless offset
                            by a multitude of
                            assumptions or a limitation of hand range/environment. In my work, I offer two algorithms
                            that I prove are
                            quicker than other state-of-the-art methods to find the center of palm of a hand, and to
                            find a line that
                            separates the forearm from the hand (wrist points) and methods that discover the area of the
                            hand with
                            far fewer assumptions.

                            and submitted it for approval. My work was accepted and included as a part of the conference
                            and in a collection of

                            This is a published course that I created a year after getting my Master's Degree in Computer
                            Science. My motivation behind making the course
                            came with my experience in the programming sphere. I was very passionate to change my career
                            path allow myself to solve problems through automation, but I found it to be very difficult
                            because of the lack of foundation. As I learned to program, and went
                            through my Master's program, I realized that there is a serious gap between knowing nothing
                            about computer science and programming
                            you first <code>Hello World!</code>. I realized that traditional education fails to acknowledge or
                            assist with this; and there is certainly
                            no assistance for those changing their careers - it seemed hopeless.

                                So, my course helps students to THINK differently. I do not regurgitate information found in
                                a book, and I don't state facts without
                                how to think about the facts. Instead, in teaching computer science fundamentals, I teach a
                                student how to <em>think</em> like a
                                developer.

                All of these projects are ongoing, and they are only getting better over time. I'm always looking to
                improve my works given any spare time outside
                of my normal work life. The title of each of the below projects links to a visual of the project, be it a
                GitHub Page or a web page. For some of the projects, look out for links to the source code.

                                Working at Abacode Cybersecurity & Compliance, I learned a lot about cybersecurity and about
                                how to build an application from the ground upwards. I am proud to say that I was (and still am)
                                a proud founder of <strong>Abacode SCOUT&copy</strong> by defining the problem, helping management and executives
                                understand the steps to develop it, designing the cloud architecture for it, and actually developing
                                it.

                                HTML, and Typescript; and to get the project up and running I worked in so many other areas like
                                UI/UX design for the initial release, assisting marketing to get a commercial created, and troubleshooting

                                My Master's Degree thesis work was in hand gesture detection in monochromatic thermal images.
                                Clarkson University is working on being able to identify fingertips of hands so that traces from
                                a hand can be used to communicate using Artificial Intelligence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My work on this project was to identify hand gestures and locate the fingertips of the hand. After starting the project,
                                I identified a hole in the field of computer vision: finding a hand area in a monochromatic thermal image.
                                For example, how can you know if the object in the image is not just a cup of hot coffee, or in what direction
                                the hand is oriented, or even if the object is indeed a hand but is distorted due to thermal pollution?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So worked to discover a way to identify the hands in the image, and find the center of palm and the wrist points.
                                I defended my thesis to a board and succeeded, finishing my Master's Degree.

                                This is a Google Chrome extension that is used to allow someone to quickly jot down notes while they are in their Google Chrome
                                browser. The notes are compiled in a summary page, and you can modify them in a typical TODO-List format. I made this because I
                                worked for two startups and I was always looking to quickly write something down, but had no clue where to put it. I wanted a TODO
                                list somewhere, but I didn't want it stored in any database or in any notebook.

                                Academy 2023</a> to learn about how Chrome extensions work and how to program one. After completing the 3 hour course, I immediately
                                created the extension and went through the entire process of getting it into the Google Chrome store.

                                This is a tool that a computer vision researcher can use to simply label their images, one by one, without
                                the administrative task of clicking on each image, saving the new name, and closing the image. This reduces
                                the time of labeling images by at least 25%, and it also segregates the labeled images from those that were
                                elected to not be labeled (skips images).

                                I used a tool of my own making to label my images for my Master's Thesis work. I had amazing code that really
                                helped to make labeling faster and better. Unfortunately I have misplaced that code, so I am now redeveloping it
                                and putting it into GitHub for others to use. I intend to add a <em>region selection</em> that will allow for selecting
                                and labeling sub-regions of an image, and also a <em>randomized region isolator</em> that will isolate randomized
                                regions of an image and store them as separate images, so as to obtain a library/database of sub-images for machine
                                learning training.

                                some royalty-free images and sounds bites online to yield a Harry Potter themed version of Simon Says that I call "Ballow Says".

                                This was a project in which I participated as the lead machine learnist. I planned the data collection
                                methods and drew schematics and instructions for my teammates. After they collected data of cardboard boxes
                                (the obstacles to be avoided) and collected data in two different rooms, I carefully labeled and separated images
                                to prepare for machine learning (a 6-month labor of love).
                            </p>

                                I was able to train a machine learning model to identify regions of the image containing a cardboard box regardless
                                of camera panning or vantage point to an accuracy of approximately 98% using <code>Tensorflow</code>, <code>Keras</code>
                                and <code>OpenCV</code> packages. Using this my team was able to write an algorithm to have the drone fly from point A to
                                point B, avoiding the box along the travel path.

                                While working at Abacode Cybersecurity & Compliance, I wanted to contribute to my company to
                                help other groups succeed. As the only developer at Abacode (at the time) I wanted to show the
                                other teams that I could help them to make their jobs simpler (and admittedly I just really like
                                programming). I presented this work to the other team, and it reduced the amount of time to create
                                reports by 95% with an obvious 100% increased fidelity.

                                with Airtable in a very simply way. It is a package that I developed to make some of my starter
                                projects have access to a cheap (mostly free) database without having to do too much work to
                                setup the database.
                            </p>

                                I developed this package to accommodate three different projects I worked on for friends and family.
                                The package itself is always getting better, and I hope to put it in pypi for others to use as well.
