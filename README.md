# Professional Portfolio - James Michael Ballow
## Purpose
This portfolio is public for the purposes of advancing my careerpath in the field of computer science. Programming, integrating, and engineering solutions and tooling is a huge passion of mine, and I will continue to exhibit these skills through the use of a GitHub Page, which is connected to some of my other work.

## My Project History
Unfortunately, programmers are forced to relinquish all claims to code that is generated during terms of employment to their respective companies as company property. Because of this, I am prepared to completley discuss my project history, however I cannot show all of the code. To combat this, I have decided to demonstrate my skills through small projects stored in my GitHub that I work on each day after work. These smaller projects are linked to my portfolio in this repo, and you can access them by visiting my [Professional Portfolio GitHub Page](https://jamesmichaelballowprojects.github.io/professional_profile/).

## Updates
I expect to update this portfolio as I accomplish more things and start/update projects (be on the lookout!).

## Code Use
My intention with this portfolio is to showcase my skills and proficiencies. I don't intend on profiting from the work from this personal portfolio, so please feel free to take anything from this repo for your own purposes, but please give me some credit by putting my name and information into your work (e.g., email, name, data of access, etc).
